<p>i wonder what it's like to be able to breathe through gills and lungs at the same time
<br/>
we will evolve to use less of our body over time once we figure out how to conserve energy better
<br/>
imagine if our descendants a million years into the future are 130083480230x more functioning than we are in every way
<br/>
that's tens, if not hundreds of thousands of generations
<br/>
<br/>
i hate sleeping 8 hours every day that's so much time wasted
<br/>
it sucks when you neglect sleep you start to physically feel like garbage so you have to do something about it

<p>i had a compilation of weird dreams last night
<br/>
one of them was with my sister who passed away 4 years ago and i hardly thought about her recently and i still had a dream with her in it
<br/>
she had some new friend that was roughly her age and we were in some hospital
<br/>
i know her friend had black hair and some ear piercings but thats it</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/17/19</h2>
<p>i had a dream last night that there were a group of people living on the sun called the sakis and they traded using the currency of certain light values
<br/>
for some reason in the dream it looked like there was another big sun but it was some stars and also the earth
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/13/19</h2>
<p>i had a dream where everyone was assigned to an A, B, or C class and these  2 twins were B-1 and B-2 but they got switched over to the A group because many of the A members were killed in a battle inside this huge assembly and the C group was completely vacant and after the twins moved the B group became vacant too
<br/>
i had another dream where i was riding a bicycle on the road which i thought was completely normal and a woman was riding a silver van behind me and i swerved on the road because i freaked out about a van being behind me so i landed in the snowy grass
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/11/19</h2>
<p>i remember i had this dream the other day where i was battling a huge dragon with one of my previous crushes and it was rpg style so we took turns fighting it and we used different moves and i think in one she either had a minecraft elytra or something similar to it with 2 separate parts attached
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>10/27/19</h2>
<p>ok i had a bunch of weird dreams
<br/>
in 1 i was driving across the bridge on the interstate and for whatever reason the physics of the universe caused me to fall off it and hide underneath it so i wrote in my own blood "HELP ME" hoping someone would help me escape
<br/>
then after about 5-10 minutes someone was up to confused so i panicked until i realized it was some old friend i knew about
<br/>
like they had arrived
<br/>
so we talked and eventually he helped me out and in my dream i had 3 laptops, one was 3x bigger than the other and i had them in my car
<br/>
i had this other weird dream where i was watching this woman and guy be disintegrated into a million pieces and watched their blood go everywhere
<br/>
the woman was screaming
<br/>
and i sliced the bottom of the guys head off
<br/>
but there was someone with me that said that if you think about cutting any other parts you wont sleep easy tonight
<br/>
and we were on a ship
<br/>
and it was raining and storming badly outside
<br/>
it was close to night time
<br/>
the guy died but the woman didnt
<br/>
the woman witnessed the guys death
<br/>
and i woke up to the woman screaming because my reality was finally telling me it was a dream
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>10/10/19</h2>
<p>i had a dream within a dream
<br/>
so basically theres this app i got that recorded all of my recent dreams, and it was compilation of clips that my mind was able to process that lasted up to around 20-40 seconds at most
<br/>
and in one of those dreams it was me driving with a ton of cars outside the area i work at at night time
<br/>
what was weird was the fact that we were talking about the app here
<br/>
and idk who else but i remember he mentioned it by posting an image of the dream catchers here and we talked about it here
<br/>
i had another dream within a dream where i was inside this school and in the dream i was wearing glasses and was getting help from a teacher
<br/>
it was a science class with some project we were working on
<br/>
and in other dreams of dreams were creepy clips of me making weird and sinister sounds
