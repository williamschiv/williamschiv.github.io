<p>The Puppetmaster from Avatar: The Last Airbender has to be my favorite episode of the entire series so far, or at least one of them. I like the whole premise of being able to bloodbend and Hama teaching you new methods to waterbend. I think what fascinates me the most is being able to explore new techniques and how to use them. Hama does exactly this with Katara and we learn new ways she can waterbend.
<br/>
Brilliant episode. I wish to see more like this.
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>12/21/22</h2>

<p>i had a dream there was this large tank of a vast variety of marine life and it was in a classroom environment so we had to choose which one would survive out of all of them and the tank was going wild as all the animals were brutally feeding and munching on each other
<br/>
i chose catfish not understanding the prompt but i wanted to change it to turtle

<div class="flex-items"><h2>12/17/22</h2>
<p>i had a dream where a rat was trying to eat a cat alive and when the cat tried to escape you could see it had a large deformed nose but quickly after it did this the rat snatched on to the cat and resumed trying to eat it</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>12/13/22</h2>
<p>i wonder what it's like to be able to breathe through gills and lungs at the same time
<br/>
we will evolve to use less of our body over time once we figure out how to conserve energy better
<br/>
imagine if our descendants a million years into the future are 130083480230x more functioning than we are in every way
<br/>
that's tens, if not hundreds of thousands of generations
<br/>
<br/>
i hate sleeping 8 hours every day that's so much time wasted
<br/>
it sucks when you neglect sleep you start to physically feel like garbage so you have to do something about it
</p></div>

<br/>
the key to life is to be yourself

<br/>
otherwise it just gets boring

<div class="flex-items"><h2>07/29/20</h2>
<p>i can hear so many voices in my head at once
<br/>
i feel like the otherworldly powers are reaching their hands that look sinister trying to tell me a message
<br/>
all at once
<br/>
and i hear a bunch of voices echoing inside my brain all at once
<br/>
i dont know which one i want to listen to
<br/>
i cant focus
<br/>
theres too many
<br/>
all the spiritual bonds have lead up to this
<br/>
my brain feels like its shrinking
<br/>
when your growth of knowledge expands does that mean your brain is getting smaller
<br/>
because its always at a constant
<br/>
how does that even work
<br/>
im too retarded to understand
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>07/26/20</h2>
<p>i had a dream i was actually watching a movie because i havent been watching movies in like a few weeks and essentally the me in my dream was making fun of me for not watching movies</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>07/16/20</h2>
<p>i had a dream marshmello sang soulja boy</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>07/06/20</h2>
<p>
i had a dream my family was holding a party to mock me and all of my family members had telekinesis so they used their own mind control to lock me in one place which happened to be in the kitchen while i was trying to get something to drink and i was yelling for them to let me go then the police eventually came and arrested them all and they all immediately got sent to prison and as they did i was talking to one of the guards walking around the prison courtyard about the scenery of the prison itself and the hinges they had that kept the prisoners inside their cell
<br/>
another thing that happened in my dream was i was playing pool with agent cooper and some other guy i forgot who it was but during the entire game we kept smirking at one another acting like we were all outwitting each other
<br/>
i dont remember who won
<br/>
you remember the scene in twin peaks where agent cooper was dreaming about laura and the tibetian guy
<br/>
mine was almost like that
<br/>
some random person i dont know was there
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>07/03/20</h2>
<p>i had a dream someone in our community came up with the most deliberate suicide attempt so we had to find all the clues as to why they did so and the clues were either through notes or internet search terms and one of them was porn of oxes holding a stick of meat slapping rears and then it turned into a huge debate about what we all thought about modern rap</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>06/14/20</h2>
<p>i had a dream there was a worldwide musical event where everyone around the world participated in a dance battle but then as the event progressed it turned into an apocalypse and a lot of people ended up dying during the event. the dream later cuts to a man running out in the apocalyptical land trying to survive as he has to stop and sit underneath a house because there was a mushroom parasite that infected him so he has to rub his face with mossy stone and he shouts "MUSHROOM MAN" as half of his face is completely covered, completely blinding one of his sides. then there was another person climbing up a set of stairs running from the apocalypse too who encounters a wasp but manages to grab it with their fingers and squash it, which ended up creating static electricity in the process</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>06/10/20</h2>
<p>i had a dream there was a woman who had to go to the hospital because over 50% of her body was covered in tar and they told her to remove the tar out of her body it had to be removed by mouth or by the stomach so the woman on the first day said she wanted it done by stomach and they said she could come back once every 4 days to remove a quarter of the tar in her body until it was fully removed</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>12/04/19</h2>
<p>i had a compilation of weird dreams last night
<br/>
one of them was with my sister who passed away 4 years ago and i hardly thought about her recently and i still had a dream with her in it
<br/>
she had some new friend that was roughly her age and we were in some hospital
<br/>
i know her friend had black hair and some ear piercings but thats it</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/17/19</h2>
<p>i had a dream last night that there were a group of people living on the sun called the sakis and they traded using the currency of certain light values
<br/>
for some reason in the dream it looked like there was another big sun but it was some stars and also the earth
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/13/19</h2>
<p>i had a dream where everyone was assigned to an A, B, or C class and these  2 twins were B-1 and B-2 but they got switched over to the A group because many of the A members were killed in a battle inside this huge assembly and the C group was completely vacant and after the twins moved the B group became vacant too
<br/>
i had another dream where i was riding a bicycle on the road which i thought was completely normal and a woman was riding a silver van behind me and i swerved on the road because i freaked out about a van being behind me so i landed in the snowy grass
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>11/11/19</h2>
<p>i remember i had this dream the other day where i was battling a huge dragon with one of my previous crushes and it was rpg style so we took turns fighting it and we used different moves and i think in one she either had a minecraft elytra or something similar to it with 2 separate parts attached
</p></div>
<div class="flex-items"><h2>10/27/19</h2>
<p>ok i had a bunch of weird dreams
<br/>
in 1 i was driving across the bridge on the interstate and for whatever reason the physics of the universe caused me to fall off it and hide underneath it so i wrote in my own blood "HELP ME" hoping someone would help me escape
<br/>
then after about 5-10 minutes someone was up to confused so i panicked until i realized it was some old friend i knew about
<br/>
like they had arrived
<br/>
so we talked and eventually he helped me out and in my dream i had 3 laptops, one was 3x bigger than the other and i had them in my car
<br/>
i had this other weird dream where i was watching this woman and guy be disintegrated into a million pieces and watched their blood go everywhere
<br/>
the woman was screaming
<br/>
and i sliced the bottom of the guys head off
<br/>

<br/>
and in one of those dreams it was me driving with a ton of cars outside the area i work at at night time
