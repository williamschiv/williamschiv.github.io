<br/>
<p>the greatest game is obviously chess
<br/>
unless you mean a video game
<br/>
in which case i think either tetris or minecraft
<br/>
tetris, pacman, minecraft, chess, pong are some of the greatest games of ALL TIME
<br/>
minecraft is objectively the greatest game of all time
<br/>
i literally can't think of a game that can even come close to the level it has
<br/>
in a way minecraft is just a very realistic arg
<br/>
not even terraria can come close to minecraft
<br/>
minecraft is 101348051308x better than terraria
<br/>
lol the funny thing with minecraft is you can actually CREATE chess, tetris, pong; etc in it
<br/>
there is no better game than minecraft you literally cannot compare</p>
<h2>01/06/23</h2>
<br/>
<p>so if i lay down i'm flat, even more proof the earth is flat</p>
<h2>01/05/23</h2>
<br/>
<p>all my atoms have their own consciousness</p>
<h2>01/03/23</h2>
<br/>
<p>don't you hate having feelings
<br/>
i wish i was emotionless
<br/><br/><br/>
if ouroboros eats itself does that mean it will poof out of existence like a black hole
</p>
<h2>01/02/23</h2>
<br/>
<p>would humans be dumber if they were cold blooded?</p>
<h2>01/01/23</h2>
<br/>
<p>trust nobody not even your nobody</p>
<h2>12/31/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i hate these human limitations
<br/>
i always feel like i'm enslaved
<br/>
idk how i can focus better
<br/>
it's hard to when i'm constantly feeling hungry every 3 hours
</p>
<h2>12/30/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>what is unnatural but necessary?
<br/>
sex is natural but not necessary to survival
<br/><br/><br/>
i don't think solipsism is real i create alternate universes inside of my mind which are not of this world
<br/><br/><br/>
i had this infinite docks dream a few years ago but i don't remember when
<br/>
but basically in the dream i was running down these docks and each dock had its own label and i was in dock #99991
<br/>
there was a small red boat to the right side with a little area and to the right you could see the ocean
<br/>
the patterns kept repeating no matter how much you ran
<br/>
same shops, boats, alleys; etc
<br/>
it's one of the few dreams i can envision nearly perfectly to this day
</p>
<h2>12/28/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>we clowns are the biggest clowns you will find</p>
<h2>12/23/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>The Puppetmaster from Avatar: The Last Airbender has to be my favorite episode of the entire series so far, or at least one of them. I like the whole premise of being able to bloodbend and Hama teaching you new methods to waterbend. I think what fascinates me the most is being able to explore new techniques and how to use them. Hama does exactly this with Katara and we learn new ways she can waterbend.
<br/>
Brilliant episode. I wish to see more like this.
</p>
<h2>12/21/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i should combine songs more
<br/>
like have 2 completely opposing genres and listen to them at the exact same time
</p>
<h2>12/19/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream there was this large tank of a vast variety of marine life and it was in a classroom environment so we had to choose which one would survive out of all of them and the tank was going wild as all the animals were brutally feeding and munching on each other
<br/>
i chose catfish not understanding the prompt but i wanted to change it to turtle
</p>
<h2>12/17/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream where a rat was trying to eat a cat alive and when the cat tried to escape you could see it had a large deformed nose but quickly after it did this the rat snatched on to the cat and resumed trying to eat it</p>
<h2>12/13/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i wonder what it's like to be able to breathe through gills and lungs at the same time
<br/>
we will evolve to use less of our body over time once we figure out how to conserve energy better
<br/>
imagine if our descendants a million years into the future are 130083480230x more functioning than we are in every way
<br/>
that's tens, if not hundreds of thousands of generations
<br/>
<br/>
i hate sleeping 8 hours every day that's so much time wasted
<br/>
it sucks when you neglect sleep you start to physically feel like garbage so you have to do something about it
</p>
<h2>12/11/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>yo dj khaled has some great advice
<br/>
the key to life is to be yourself
<br/><br/>
i don't like being a human and doing basic human needs, i only like the part where i can apply what i know and go from there
<br/>
otherwise it just gets boring
</p>
<h2>12/08/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>aren't you sad there isn't an m&m movie</p>
<h2>12/02/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>what would you do if your happy meal smiled back at you</p>
<h2>11/30/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>yo twitter where's your life support LOL</p>
<h2>11/25/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>do you think there will ever be a platform that will overtake youtube</p>
<h2>11/22/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>what if we were arthropods
<br/>
i wish armored fish were still alive
</p>
<h2>11/06/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>better call saul should've ended on episode 9, what a terrible last 4 episodes
<br/>
everything was already set in stone
</p>
<h2>10/03/22</h2>
<br/>
<p>i ran at a squirrel a week ago and it started making noises around the other squirrels</p>
<h2>12/26/21</h2>
<br/>
<p>being unborn and being dead are literally the same thing</p>
<h2>12/25/21</h2>
<br/>
<p>ice cube didn't get the vaccine and he lost 9 million dollars because of it</p>
<h2>11/08/21</h2>
<br/>
<p>i remember what i remember</p>
<h2>12/08/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>idk how normal people find it easy to sleep consistently every day</p>
<h2>07/29/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i can hear so many voices in my head at once
<br/>
i feel like the otherworldly powers are reaching their hands that look sinister trying to tell me a message
<br/>
all at once
<br/>
and i hear a bunch of voices echoing inside my brain all at once
<br/>
i dont know which one i want to listen to
<br/>
i cant focus
<br/>
theres too many
<br/>
all the spiritual bonds have lead up to this
<br/>
my brain feels like its shrinking
<br/>
when your growth of knowledge expands does that mean your brain is getting smaller
<br/>
because its always at a constant
<br/>
how does that even work
<br/>
im too retarded to understand
</p>
<h2>07/26/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream i was actually watching a movie because i havent been watching movies in like a few weeks and essentally the me in my dream was making fun of me for not watching movies</p>
<h2>07/20/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>
ive had a dream of this one specific area that i always think about
<br/>
its this small circular gorge leading into this lake
<br/>
ive had memory of this specific area for years
<br/>
and i can never get it out of my head
<br/>
i dont know where its at all i know is its a cognitive place my mind has come up with for me
<br/>
its possible it exists
<br/>
it does exist
<br/>
but idk where
<br/>
every time i think about that place i always question if im ever going to find it
<br/>
to be able to step foot on it
<br/>
its such an atmospheric place
<br/>
i wouldnt mind living there
<br/>
i keep thinking about it
<br/>
no one will ever understand what im talking about because you cannot put it into words
<br/>
like i am serious when i say this but i desperately want to go there
<br/>
even if someone is mind controlling me to want to do this
<br/>
ok i lost the thought of what this place was to me but now i remember
<br/>
its my own embodiment of a utopia ive created
<br/>
i think
<br/>
theres no other explanation for what it could be
<br/>
utopias exist
</p>
<h2>07/16/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream marshmello sang soulja boy</p>
<h2>07/06/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>
i had a dream my family was holding a party to mock me and all of my family members had telekinesis so they used their own mind control to lock me in one place which happened to be in the kitchen while i was trying to get something to drink and i was yelling for them to let me go then the police eventually came and arrested them all and they all immediately got sent to prison and as they did i was talking to one of the guards walking around the prison courtyard about the scenery of the prison itself and the hinges they had that kept the prisoners inside their cell
<br/>
another thing that happened in my dream was i was playing pool with agent cooper and some other guy i forgot who it was but during the entire game we kept smirking at one another acting like we were all outwitting each other
<br/>
i dont remember who won
<br/>
you remember the scene in twin peaks where agent cooper was dreaming about laura and the tibetian guy
<br/>
mine was almost like that
<br/>
some random person i dont know was there
</p>
<h2>07/03/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream someone in our community came up with the most deliberate suicide attempt so we had to find all the clues as to why they did so and the clues were either through notes or internet search terms and one of them was porn of oxes holding a stick of meat slapping rears and then it turned into a huge debate about what we all thought about modern rap</p>
<h2>06/14/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream there was a worldwide musical event where everyone around the world participated in a dance battle but then as the event progressed it turned into an apocalypse and a lot of people ended up dying during the event. the dream later cuts to a man running out in the apocalyptical land trying to survive as he has to stop and sit underneath a house because there was a mushroom parasite that infected him so he has to rub his face with mossy stone and he shouts "MUSHROOM MAN" as half of his face is completely covered, completely blinding one of his sides. then there was another person climbing up a set of stairs running from the apocalypse too who encounters a wasp but manages to grab it with their fingers and squash it, which ended up creating static electricity in the process</p>
<h2>06/10/20</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream there was a woman who had to go to the hospital because over 50% of her body was covered in tar and they told her to remove the tar out of her body it had to be removed by mouth or by the stomach so the woman on the first day said she wanted it done by stomach and they said she could come back once every 4 days to remove a quarter of the tar in her body until it was fully removed</p>
<h2>12/04/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a compilation of weird dreams last night
<br/>
one of them was with my sister who passed away 4 years ago and i hardly thought about her recently and i still had a dream with her in it
<br/>
she had some new friend that was roughly her age and we were in some hospital
<br/>
i know her friend had black hair and some ear piercings but thats it</p>
<h2>11/17/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream last night that there were a group of people living on the sun called the sakis and they traded using the currency of certain light values
<br/>
for some reason in the dream it looked like there was another big sun but it was some stars and also the earth
</p>
<h2>11/13/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream where everyone was assigned to an A, B, or C class and these  2 twins were B-1 and B-2 but they got switched over to the A group because many of the A members were killed in a battle inside this huge assembly and the C group was completely vacant and after the twins moved the B group became vacant too
<br/>
i had another dream where i was riding a bicycle on the road which i thought was completely normal and a woman was riding a silver van behind me and i swerved on the road because i freaked out about a van being behind me so i landed in the snowy grass
</p>
<h2>11/11/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i remember i had this dream the other day where i was battling a huge dragon with one of my previous crushes and it was rpg style so we took turns fighting it and we used different moves and i think in one she either had a minecraft elytra or something similar to it with 2 separate parts attached
</p>
<h2>10/27/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>ok i had a bunch of weird dreams
<br/>
in 1 i was driving across the bridge on the interstate and for whatever reason the physics of the universe caused me to fall off it and hide underneath it so i wrote in my own blood "HELP ME" hoping someone would help me escape
<br/>
then after about 5-10 minutes someone was up to confused so i panicked until i realized it was some old friend i knew about
<br/>
like they had arrived
<br/>
so we talked and eventually he helped me out and in my dream i had 3 laptops, one was 3x bigger than the other and i had them in my car
<br/>
i had this other weird dream where i was watching this woman and guy be disintegrated into a million pieces and watched their blood go everywhere
<br/>
the woman was screaming
<br/>
and i sliced the bottom of the guys head off
<br/>
but there was someone with me that said that if you think about cutting any other parts you wont sleep easy tonight
<br/>
and we were on a ship
<br/>
and it was raining and storming badly outside
<br/>
it was close to night time
<br/>
the guy died but the woman didnt
<br/>
the woman witnessed the guys death
<br/>
and i woke up to the woman screaming because my reality was finally telling me it was a dream
</p>
<h2>10/10/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream within a dream
<br/>
so basically theres this app i got that recorded all of my recent dreams, and it was compilation of clips that my mind was able to process that lasted up to around 20-40 seconds at most
<br/>
and in one of those dreams it was me driving with a ton of cars outside the area i work at at night time
<br/>
what was weird was the fact that we were talking about the app here
<br/>
and idk who else but i remember he mentioned it by posting an image of the dream catchers here and we talked about it here
<br/>
i had another dream within a dream where i was inside this school and in the dream i was wearing glasses and was getting help from a teacher
<br/>
it was a science class with some project we were working on
<br/>
and in other dreams of dreams were creepy clips of me making weird and sinister sounds
</p>
<h2>09/24/19</h2>
<br/>
<p>i just remembered i had a dream last night where i was driving and accidentally hit a womans car in their driveway and she acted a little cold about it at first but we talked and she actually invited me inside her house so she introduced me to her husband and kids and fed me waffles with rainbow sprinkles</p>

<h2>12/28/18</h2>
<br/>
<p>
the issue i have with odyssey is its insanely easy, and you get rewarded with nothing after every boss fight
<br/>
theres also the perfect run at the end of the game that only rewards you with the title of beating the game and an invisible outfit
<br/>
I want to sell my copy of odyssey
<br/>
I beat it in 2 days, and it's extremely boring
<br/>
I had fun until I beat the game
<br/>
i'm going to play odyssey again just to see how bad it is
<br/>
not now though
<br/>
also the sand kingdom resembles botw perfectly
<br/>
how?
<br/>
theres a small village and then around that village is absolutely nothing
<br/>
thats what botw mainly consists of
<br/>
most of my gameplay spent with botw is simply walking around
<br/>
the only interesting parts of the game were when you could actually fight the blight ganons and strategize against them
<br/>
I like BotW
<br/>
i had to look up videos on how to beat the divine beasts during my first playthrough on every single one of them because of how cheap each challenge was thrown at you with barely any indication
<br/>
I've spent almost 340 hours playing it and haven't gotten bored
</p>
<h2>11/13/18</h2>
<br/>
<p>the less you worry, the more productive you can be</p>
<h2>11/10/18</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream that i was reporting a dream i had
<br/>
and then i woke up thinking it was the middle of the night
</p>
<h2>09/19/18</h2>
<br/>
<p>i had a dream where a lot of my stuff was warped into a different dimension and i was trying to figure out what i still had with me</p>
